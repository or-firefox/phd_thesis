Recent neutrino and Dark Matter search  experiments have revolutionized the detection of rear events, and rear  events with low energies, in particular. Experiments have achieved  sensitivities on the level of several events per hundred kg of detector  material per day with energy thresholds from few hundred eV. This opens up a  new unique possibility for experimental detection of neutrino-nucleus  coherent scattering that has been considered to be impossible so far. The  νGeN project uses low threshold high-purity Ge-detectors (HPGe)  developed by JINR (Dubna, Russia) in collaboration with BSI (Baltic  Scientific Instruments, Riga, Latvia) for creation of a setup designated for  first observation of neutrino coherent scattering on Ge. As a powerful  neutrino source the experiment will use electron antineutrinos from one of  the power-generating units (reactor unit #3) of the KNPP. The  coherent neutrino scattering will be observed using a differential method  that compares 1) the spectra measured at the reactor operation and shut-down  periods; 2) the spectra measured at different distances from the reactor  core during the reactor operation. For a setup placed at a 10 m distance  from the center of reactor core and with an energy threshold of 350 eV up to  tens of events corresponding to neutrino coherent scattering on Ge are  expected to be detected per day in the constructed setup with four HPGe  low-energy-threshold detectors (∼400 grams each). The setup  sensitivity will be even more increased by using new detectors with total  mass up to 5 kg.}

The recoil of the nuclei hit by the antineutrinos is detected with four high-purity point contact Germanium detectors with a very low threshold and an overall mass of about 4 kg. To suppress the background, the setup is equipped with a shell-like passive shield and an active muon veto system. The shield and the muon veto have successfully been tested at the shallow depth laboratory at Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to reproduce the prompt muon-induced background and to examine the induced neutron spectrum. Currently, the low threshold Germanium detectors are characterized and the experiment is prepared for commissioning.}

These are expected to reach unprecedentedly low energy thresholds, in the 10 eV-regime and below. This technology allows new approaches in rare-event searches, including the search for MeV-scale dark matter, detection of solar neutrinos and a rapid discovery of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CNNS) at a nuclear reactor. We show a simple scaling law for the performance of cryogenic calorimeters, allowing the extrapolation of existing device performances to smaller sizes. Measurement results with a 0.5 g sapphire detector are presented. This prototype reached a threshold of 20 eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than previous results with massive calorimeters. We discuss an experiment, called ν-cleus, which enables a 5-σ discovery of CNNS within about 2 weeks of measuring time at 40 m distance from a power reactor. In a second stage, this experiment enables precision measurements of the CNNS cross-section and spectral shape for new physics within and beyond the Standard Model.}

The module is capable of simulating particle sources, performing particle tracking, generating photons of primary and secondary scintillation, tracing optical photons and generating photosensor signals. The reconstruction module features several position reconstruction methods based on the statistical reconstruction algorithms (including GPU-based implementations), artificial neural networks and k-NN searches. The module can process simulated as well as imported experimental data containing photosensor signals. A custom library for B-spline parameterization of spatial response of photosensors is implemented which can be used to calculate and parameterize the spatial response of a detector. The package includes a graphical user interface with an extensive set of configuration, visualization and analysis tools. ANTS2 is being developed with the focus on the iterative (adaptive) reconstruction of the detector response using flood field irradiation data. The package is implemented in C++ programming language and it is a multiplatform, open source project.}

These signals, which show the excellent sensitivity of the detector to small charge signals, are explained as being due to the photoionization of impurities in the liquid xenon and of the metal components inside the TPC. They are used as a unique calibration source to characterize the detector. We explain how we can infer crucial parameters for the XENON100 experiment: the secondary-scintillation gain, the extraction yield from the liquid to the gas phase and the electron drift velocity.}

It was found that the rate of spontaneous single electron signals strongly depends on the time passed since the initial electroluminescence happened. The analysis of experimental data showed that both spontaneous single electron signals and delayed electroluminescent signals are associated with ionization electrons which are trapped by the potential barrier at the interface.}

journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {We characterize single- and few-electron backgrounds that are observed in dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers at timescales greatly exceeding a maximum drift time after an interaction. These instrumental backgrounds limit a detector's sensitivity to dark matter and cosmogenic neutrinos. Using the ∼ 150 g liquid xenon detector at Purdue University, we investigate how these backgrounds, produced after 122 keV 57Co Compton interactions, behave under different detector conditions. We find that the rates of single- and few-electron signals follow power-laws with time after the interaction. We observe linearly increasing rates with increased extraction field. The relationship of the rates in the single-electron background with increased drift field is unclear. Normalizing the rates to the primary interaction's measured ionization signal, the rates increase linearly with the depth of the interaction. We test the hypothesis that infrared photons (1550 nm) would stimulate and accelerate electron emission via photodetachment from impurities, but find that even 1 Watt of infrared light fails to reduce these backgrounds. We thus provide a characterization that can inform background models for low-energy rare event searches.}

abstract = {The DANSS project is aimed at creating a relatively compact   neutrino spectrometer which does not contain any flammable or other   dangerous liquids and may therefore be located very close to the   core of an industrial power reactor. As a result, it is expected   that high neutrino flux would provide about 15,000 IBD interactions   per day in the detector with a sensitive volume of 1 m3. High   segmentation of the plastic scintillator will allow to suppress a   background down to a ∼1% level. Numerous tests performed with   a simplified pilot prototype DANSSino under a 3 GWth   reactor of the Kalinin NPP have demonstrated operability of the   chosen design.    The DANSS detector surrounded with a composite shield is movable by   means of a special lifting gear, varying the distance to the reactor   core in a range from 10 m to 12 m. Due to this feature, it could   be used not only for the reactor monitoring, but also for   fundamental research including short-range neutrino oscillations to   the sterile state. Supposing one-year measurement, the sensitivity   to the oscillation parameters is expected to reach a level of   sin2(2θnew) ∼ 5 × 10−3 with   Δ m2 ⊂ (0.02–5.0) eV2.}

abstract = {Measurements of double photoelectron emission (DPE) probabilities as a function of wavelength are reported for Hamamatsu R8778, R8520, and R11410 VUV-sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). In DPE, a single photon strikes the PMT photocathode and produces two photoelectrons instead of a single one. It was found that the fraction of detected photons that result in DPE emission is a function of the incident photon wavelength, and manifests itself below ∼250 nm. For the xenon scintillation wavelength of 175 nm, a DPE probability of 18–24% was measured depending on the tube and measurement method. This wavelength-dependent single photon response has implications for the energy calibration and photon counting of current and future liquid xenon detectors such as LUX, LZ, XENON100/1T, Panda-X and XMASS.}

title = {Absolute Scintillation Yields in Liquid Argon and Xenon for Various Particles},
journal = {Japanese Journal of Applied Physics},
abstract = {For the determination of the absolute scintillation yields –the number of scintillation photons per unit absorbed energy– for a variety of particles in liquid argon, a series of simultaneous ionization and scintillation measurements were performed. The results verified that scintillation yields for relativistic heavy particles from Ne to La are constant despite their extensive range of linear energy transfer. Such a constant level, called “flat top response” level, manifests the maximum absolute scintillation yield in liquid argon. The maximum absolute scintillation yield is defined by the average energy to produce a single photon, Wph(max) = 19.5±1.0 eV. In liquid xenon, the existence of the same flat top response level was also found by conducting scintillation measurements on relativistic heavy particles. The Wph(max) in liquid xenon was evaluated to be 13.8±0.9 eV using the Wph for 1 MeV electrons, obtained experimentally. The ratio between the two maximum scintillation yields at the flat top response level obtained in liquid argon and xenon is in good agreement with the estimation by way of the energy resolutions of scintillation due to alpha particles in both liquids.}
