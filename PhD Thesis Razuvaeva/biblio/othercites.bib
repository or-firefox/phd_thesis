abstract="The RED-100 experimental setup, which is designed to detect elastic coherent neutrino scattering off xenon nuclei, is described. One specific feature of this setup is the possibility of using it in above ground experiments. The setup is based on the RED-100 two-phase emission detector in which liquid xenon is used as a working medium for detection of rare events. The results of the technical run with the setup are presented. These are the evidence of the normal operation of all systems and the readiness of the setup for carrying out an experiment.",

The current best limits for the interaction cross sections of supersymmetric WIMPs having a mass of 100GeV/c2 with nucleons were measured with emission detector LUX containing 360kg of liquid xenon as detector medium installed in Davis’ cave at Homestake mine in South Dakota. Emission detectors of the next generation G2, with an active detector mass of about 10 tons, will either unambiguously detect WIMPs or rule out all current theoretical predictions for WIMP existence. Detectors of the G3 generation will be used for multiple purposes including detection of double beta neutrinoless decay and low-energy neutrinos}

The centerpiece of the experiment is a large liquid xenon time projection chamber sensitive to low energy nuclear recoils. Rejection of backgrounds is enhanced by a Xe skin veto detector and by a liquid scintillator Outer Detector loaded with gadolinium for efficient neutron capture and tagging. LZ is located in the Davis Cavern at the 4850’ level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, USA. We describe the major subsystems of the experiment and its key design features and requirements.}

abstract = {The $\nu$-GeN is new experiment at the Kalinin Nuclear  Power Plant (KNPP) for detection of coherent Neutrino–Ge  Nucleus elastic scattering. Recent neutrino and Dark Matter search  experiments have revolutionized the detection of rear events, and rear  events with low energies, in particular. Experiments have achieved  sensitivities on the level of several events per hundred kg of detector  material per day with energy thresholds from few hundred eV. This opens up a  new unique possibility for experimental detection of neutrino-nucleus  coherent scattering that has been considered to be impossible so far. The  νGeN project uses low threshold high-purity Ge-detectors (HPGe)  developed by JINR (Dubna, Russia) in collaboration with BSI (Baltic  Scientific Instruments, Riga, Latvia) for creation of a setup designated for  first observation of neutrino coherent scattering on Ge. As a powerful  neutrino source the experiment will use electron antineutrinos from one of  the power-generating units (reactor unit #3) of the KNPP. The  coherent neutrino scattering will be observed using a differential method  that compares 1) the spectra measured at the reactor operation and shut-down  periods; 2) the spectra measured at different distances from the reactor  core during the reactor operation. For a setup placed at a 10 m distance  from the center of reactor core and with an energy threshold of 350 eV up to  tens of events corresponding to neutrino coherent scattering on Ge are  expected to be detected per day in the constructed setup with four HPGe  low-energy-threshold detectors (∼400 grams each). The setup  sensitivity will be even more increased by using new detectors with total  mass up to 5 kg.}

The experiment will be set up at the commercial nuclear power plant of Brokdorf, Germany, at a distance of ∼17 m to the reactor core. The recoil of the nuclei hit by the antineutrinos is detected with four high-purity point contact Germanium detectors with a very low threshold and an overall mass of about 4 kg. To suppress the background, the setup is equipped with a shell-like passive shield and an active muon veto system. The shield and the muon veto have successfully been tested at the shallow depth laboratory at Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to reproduce the prompt muon-induced background and to examine the induced neutron spectrum. Currently, the low threshold Germanium detectors are characterized and the experiment is prepared for commissioning.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {We investigate new gram-scale cryogenic detectors, 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller in size than previous devices. These are expected to reach unprecedentedly low energy thresholds, in the 10 eV-regime and below. This technology allows new approaches in rare-event searches, including the search for MeV-scale dark matter, detection of solar neutrinos and a rapid discovery of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CNNS) at a nuclear reactor. We show a simple scaling law for the performance of cryogenic calorimeters, allowing the extrapolation of existing device performances to smaller sizes. Measurement results with a 0.5 g sapphire detector are presented. This prototype reached a threshold of 20 eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than previous results with massive calorimeters. We discuss an experiment, called ν-cleus, which enables a 5-σ discovery of CNNS within about 2 weeks of measuring time at 40 m distance from a power reactor. In a second stage, this experiment enables precision measurements of the CNNS cross-section and spectral shape for new physics within and beyond the Standard Model.}

The simulation module of ANTS2 is based on ROOT package from CERN, which is used to store the detector geometry and to perform 3D navigation. The module is capable of simulating particle sources, performing particle tracking, generating photons of primary and secondary scintillation, tracing optical photons and generating photosensor signals. The reconstruction module features several position reconstruction methods based on the statistical reconstruction algorithms (including GPU-based implementations), artificial neural networks and k-NN searches. The module can process simulated as well as imported experimental data containing photosensor signals. A custom library for B-spline parameterization of spatial response of photosensors is implemented which can be used to calculate and parameterize the spatial response of a detector. The package includes a graphical user interface with an extensive set of configuration, visualization and analysis tools. ANTS2 is being developed with the focus on the iterative (adaptive) reconstruction of the detector response using flood field irradiation data. The package is implemented in C++ programming language and it is a multiplatform, open source project.}

The accuracy of reconstruction either reaches or exceeds what was achieved by the conventional approaches developed by EXO-200 over the course of the experiment. Most existing DNN approaches to event reconstruction and classification in particle physics are trained on Monte Carlo simulated events. Such algorithms are inherently limited by the accuracy of the simulation. We describe a unique approach that, in an experiment such as EXO-200, allows to successfully perform certain reconstruction and analysis tasks by training the network on waveforms from experimental data, either reducing or eliminating the reliance on the Monte Carlo.}

abstract = {The XENON100 dark matter experiment uses liquid xenon in a time projection chamber (TPC) to measure xenon nuclear recoils resulting from the scattering of dark matter weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). In this paper, we report the observation of single-electron charge signals which are not related to WIMP interactions. These signals, which show the excellent sensitivity of the detector to small charge signals, are explained as being due to the photoionization of impurities in the liquid xenon and of the metal components inside the TPC. They are used as a unique calibration source to characterize the detector. We explain how we can infer crucial parameters for the XENON100 experiment: the secondary-scintillation gain, the extraction yield from the liquid to the gas phase and the electron drift velocity.}

The measurements span a   range of electric fields from 2.4 to 7.1 kV/cm in the liquid xenon,   corresponding to 4.5 to 13.1 kV/cm in the gaseous xenon.  Extraction   efficiency continues to increase at the highest extraction fields,   implying that additional charge signal may be attained in two-phase   xenon detectors through careful high-voltage engineering of the   gate-anode region.}
